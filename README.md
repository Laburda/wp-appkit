# WP-AppKit
WP-AppKit is an open source WordPress plugin to **build PWA and mobile applications connected to WordPress**. Applications are created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Developers, you can extend and customize applications using our API.

## Getting Started
Creating apps with WP-AppKit means creating JavaScript based app themes. (More on that [here](https://github.com/uncatcrea/wp-appkit/blob/master/README.md#app-themes)).

By default, we provide 1 simple and elegant starter themes [Q for Android](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSQVx8-rqCY)). This theme is pre-installed.

## Developer Friendly
Our plugin is fully documented and we are committed to support developers. Discover the plugin and themes API on [our website](http://uncategorized-creations.com/wp-appkit/doc/). We also publish regularly [tutorials](http://uncategorized-creations.com/tag/tutorials/) to help you build great apps.

## What Is WP-AppKit?
It's a WordPress plugin which provides:
* An admin panel to configure your app
* JSON web services to feed your app with WordPress content
* A JavaScript engine to create app's themes
* Starter theme to trigger your natural inclination to unbridled creativity

When building mobile apps, WP-AppKit uses the [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) technology for the app. It means that the app is developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript but still can be distribued in app stores.

More on that [here](http://uncategorized-creations.com/wp-appkit/).

## The WordPress Admin Panel
WP-AppKit adds a menu to the WordPress admin.
* Here you can choose the targeted platform
* Pick a theme
* Pick the app's components (eg. Post List)
* Build the app's navigation
* Use Chrome to simulate your app in the browser
* Set your secure key to support WordPress authentication in your app
* Set the custom URL scheme for deeplinks
* Export app's sources ready to be compiled with raw Cordova tools or VoltBuilder online service

## App Themes
WP-AppKit allows to create themes for your apps. App themes are build with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. WP-AppKit provides a JavaScript engine able to interact with the WP-AppKit web services. It also mimics WordPress themes with files such as single, archive... You will also be able to use template tags.

However an app's theme *is not* a WordPress theme.

WP-AppKit themes use JavaScript (along with HTML and CSS) instead of PHP. Template Tags for example use [UnderscoreJS](http://underscorejs.org/).

Developing app themes are at the heart of the WP-AppKit project. If you're ready to dive into the mysteries of app themes, head to the doc: [http://uncategorized-creations.com/wp-appkit/doc/](http://uncategorized-creations.com/wp-appkit/doc/).
